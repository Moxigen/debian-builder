              Moxie Debian Custom Installation ISO Generator

Usage: 

  make help
  make prompt
  sudo [CUSTOM_VAR=foo] make
  sudo make
  sudo make clean


Recommended Usage:

  make prompt


Description:

  This Makefile and supporting files are for creating an iso based on the
  Debian businesscard netinst media.

  Currently only tested for amd64 under a VirtualBox environment.

  Review pressed.d/[TARGET_BUILD] files for available targets, the target
  configuration and the packages they contain.


Build Variables:
  If a variable is not set in the environment a default will be used.
  See the Makefile for the default values.

  CUSTOM_USERNAME: the first user on the new system
  CUSTOM_FULLNAME: the full name of the first user
  CUSTOM_TIMEZONE: timezone for the system
  CUSTOM_HOSTNAME: hostname for the system
  CUSTOM_DOMAIN:   domain for the system
  TARGET_BUILD:    Identifies the preseed.cfg.template to use [dev, test, prod]

  The DEB_ vars can be used to change the Debian Source image that is used.
  This is not recommended unless testing for a new distribution.

  DEB_VER:  debian version e.g. 6.0.3
  DEB_ARCH: target architecture e.g. amd64

Bootable ISO:

  Upon success the bootable iso can be found in the . directory.  e.g.
  ./moxie-debian-6.0.3-amd64-buisinesscard.iso.  This iso can be used to boot
  a network enable installation of Debian.

Todo Ideas:

  - Allow user selection of Locale/Keyboard seetings, or write user
    instructions on how to do so post installation. 

  - Template the preseed files so common configurations can be used across
    multiple build targets.

  - Have common builds to set CUSTOM_ vars 

  - Desktop and Server Targets (currently only 'dev' which is a desktop)
